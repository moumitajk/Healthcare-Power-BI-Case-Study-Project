# Power BI Healthcare Analytics Dashboard Project

A comprehensive Power BI project analyzing healthcare data to uncover insights related to patient treatment effectiveness, hospital utilization, recovery outcomes, and doctor workload. The project integrates multiple datasets and applies advanced DAX, Power Query, and visualization techniques to support data-driven decision-making in a clinical setting.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes patient, treatment, and hospital performance data to answer key healthcare questions using Power BI. It includes:

- **Data Modeling**: Built relationships between patient, treatment, and hospital tables.
- **Advanced DAX Calculations**: Custom measures for cohort analysis, room utilization, treatment cost, and recovery scoring.
- **Power Query Transformations**: Cleaned and extracted prescription text, filled missing values, and transformed dates.
- **Visual Dashboards**: Interactive reports for doctors, hospitals, treatment types, and patient demographics.

---

## Datasets Used

- `HealthcareDataset1.xlsx` – Patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, dates, and billing.
- `HealthcareDataset2.xlsx` – Hospital info, doctor assignments, room usage, and recovery ratings.

## Key Features

-  **Treatment Effectiveness**: Comparison of recovery ratings across different treatment types.
-  **Doctor Analysis**: Patient load vs recovery performance per doctor.
-  **Hospital Utilization**: Patients-per-room ratios and capacity insights.
-  **Cohort Trends**: Admission-based cohort analysis for treatment costs and recovery.
-  **Demographics**: Blood type distribution, age group analysis, and gender-based recovery patterns.
-  **Forecasting**: Future hospital capacity prediction using Power BI's built-in forecasting.
